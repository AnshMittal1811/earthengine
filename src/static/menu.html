<p>Note: Because of the deferred execution model used by the GEE, the generated map overlays
often build up very slowly. This is especially true for the Algorithm/Omnibus
calculation since with each chosen zoom level results are re-calculated at a
new scale.</p> 

<h3><a name="h1">Retrieve/Sentinel1</a></h3>
<p>
Retrieve a  time series of Sentinel-1 images:
Select a start and end date, "ASCENDING" or "DESCENDING" pass, relative orbit number (default any), 
and polarization ("VV,VH", "VV",  "VH", "HH,HV", "HH" or "HV").  If desired, and if
you are authenticated, select "Export to Google Drive" with a filename and scale. Use the
map rectangle tool to set a region of interest. Then click GO to start. When the result page appears
you can download the time series directly, but this may be unreliable. The Export to Drive is recommended.

<h3><a name="h2">Retrieve/Sentinel2</a></h3>
<p>
Retrieve a single Sentinel-2 image (the 10m optical/infrared bands only):
Choose a start and end date for the search. The most cloud-free image in the period will be selected.  
If desired, and if you are authenticated, select "Export to Google Drive" with a filename and scale. Use the
map rectangle tool to set a region of interest. Then click GO to start. When the result page appears
you can download the image directly, but this may be unreliable. The Export to Drive is recommended.

<h3><a name="h3">Algorithm/Omnibus</a></h3>
<p>
Run the sequential omnibus change detection algorithm on a  time series of Sentinel-1 images:
Select a start and end date, "ASCENDING" or "DESCENDING" pass, relative orbit number (default any), 
and polarization ("VV,VH", "VV",  "VH", "HH,HV", "HH" or "HV").  If desired, and if
you are authenticated, select "Export to Assets" or "Export to Google Drive" (or both) with a filename and scale. 
To run a 3x3 median filter over the P-values, check the median filter box. Use the
map rectangle tool to set a region of interest. Then click GO to start. If the calculation ends with an error
indicating ressources were exceeded, it will usually run to completion in the batch export.
The result page shows the change frequency map, a time of first change map or a time of last last change map, depending on selection,
as an overlay. You can download the change maps directly, but this may be unreliable. The Export to Assets/Drive is recommended.
If the calculation fails with an error, the export task(s) may still complete successfully.

<h3><a name="h5">Algorithm/iMAD</a></h3>
<p>
Run the IR-MAD algorithm on two images from the same platform (Landsat 5, 7, 8 or Sentinel-2). Choose the time ranges
for the images (the image with least cloud cover will be selected for each range). Select the maximum number of iterations and
use the map rectangle tool to set a region of interest. Then click GO to start. If the calculation ends with an error
indicating ressources were exceeded, it will usually run to completion in the batch export. The result page shows the resulting chi-square
image as an overlay. You can download the MAD change image directly, but this may be unreliable. The Export to Assets/Drive is recommended.
If the calculation fails with an error, the export task(s) may still complete successfully.
