<h3><a name="h1">Retrieve/Sentinel1</a></h3>
<p>
Retrieve a  time series of Sentinel-1 images:
Select a start and end date, "ASCENDING" or "DESCENDING" pass, relative orbit number (default any), 
and polarization ("VV,VH", "VV",  "VH", "HH,HV", "HH" or "HV").  If desired, and if
you are authenticated, select "Export to Google Drive" with a filename and scale. Use the
map rectangle tool to set a region of interest. Then click GO to start. When the result page appears
you can download the time series directly, but this may be unreliable. The Export to Drive is recommended.

<h3><a name="h2">Retrieve/Sentinel2</a></h3>
<p>
Retrieve a single Sentinel-2 image (the 10m optical/infrared bands only):
Choose a start and end date for the search. The most cloud-free image in the period will be selected.  
If desired, and if you are authenticated, select "Export to Google Drive" with a filename and scale. Use the
map rectangle tool to set a region of interest. Then click GO to start. When the result page appears
you can download the image directly, but this may be unreliable. The Export to Drive is recommended.

<h3><a name="h3">Algorithm/Omnibus</a></h3>
<p>
Run the sequential omnibus change detection algorithm on a  time series of Sentinel-1 images:
Select a start and end date, "ASCENDING" or "DESCENDING" pass, relative orbit number (default any), 
and polarization ("VV,VH", "VV",  "VH", "HH,HV", "HH" or "HV").  If desired, and if
you are authenticated, select "Export to Assets" or "Export to Google Drive" (or both) with a filename and scale. Use the
map rectangle tool to set a region of interest. Then click GO to start. The result page shows the change frequency map
as an overlay. You can download the change maps directly, but this may be unreliable. The Export to Assets/Drive is recommended.

<h3><a name="h4">Algorithm/Wishart</a></h3>
<p>
Run the bitemporal complex Wishart change detection algorithm on two Sentinel-1 images:
Select start and end dates to locate the first and second images, "ASCENDING" or "DESCENDING" pass, relative orbit number (default any), 
and polarization ("VV,VH", "VV",  "VH", "HH,HV", "HH" or "HV").  If desired, and if
you are authenticated, select "Export to assets" or "Export to Google Drive" (or both) with a filename and scale. Use the
map rectangle tool to set a region of interest. Then click GO to start. The result page shows the change map
as an overlay. You can download the change map directly, but this may be unreliable. The Export to Assets/Drive is recommended.
